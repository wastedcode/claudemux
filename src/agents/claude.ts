 * permission-prompt detection and handling defer to v0.1 as one unit. With no
 * substrings the `permissionPrompt` rule returns `false`, so a prompt
 * classifies as `unknown`, never `idle`. `permission-prompt` stays a reserved
 * member of the public `State` type; v0.1 begins emitting it (non-breaking)
 * once this const is populated, paired with a `respond()` primitive to answer
 * the prompt. The enumerated shapes (the v0.1 starting point) live in
 * `test/fixtures/permission-prompt-classifier-fixture.json`; the v0.0.1
 * consequence and the non-interactive-mode workaround are documented in README §5.

/**
 * Is the REPL idle and ready for *new* input? True when the bottom-N pane
 * contains an **empty** input box — a line that is exactly the ready glyph
 * followed by only whitespace (`/^❯\s*$/`; the empty box is `❯` + U+00A0 in
 * claude 2.1.153, and `\s` covers U+00A0).
 *
 * Three things this gets right, all confirmed against authenticated 2.1.153:
 *   - **Footer below the prompt.** 2.1.153 renders a status footer
 *     (`⏵⏵ bypass permissions on …` or `? for shortcuts …`) on the line(s)
 *     *below* `❯`, so the bottom-most non-blank line is the footer, not the
 *     prompt. Scanning bottom-N for the box (not taking the last line) fixes
 *     spawn-ready, `state→idle`, and `wait`.
 *   - **Draft echo is NOT idle.** A pasted-but-unsubmitted turn shows
 *     `❯ <draft text>` — non-empty after the glyph — so it does not match.
 *     This is what stops `wait` from reading the post-`send` echo as a
 *     completed turn (silent turn-loss).
 *   - **Menu selection is NOT idle.** Theme/trust menus render `❯ 1. …` (a
 *     digit follows) and are indented, so they don't match the column-0
 *     empty box. (Dialogs are also caught earlier by their own matchers.)
 *
 * NOTE: structural readiness is necessary but not sufficient — the caller
 * (`boot.ts`) must also confirm the pane is *stable* before declaring ready,
 * because the empty box can flash during the welcome/MCP-init render before
 * input is actually interactive. See `wait-needs-a-transition-not-a-snapshot`.
